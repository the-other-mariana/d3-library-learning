## Usage

For simplicity's purposes, the built-in server from python will be used to host the practices. <br />

1. Open a terminal. <br />

2. Go to the directory of the folder where the `index` file is located. <br />

3. Type: <br/>
```
$: python -m http.server
```
4. You need to see the output: <br />
```
$: Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
```
5. The server is running. Now, go to `http://localhost:8000/` in chrome web browser. <br/>

6. To stop the server, type `Ctrl+C`.
